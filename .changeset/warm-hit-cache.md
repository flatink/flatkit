Warm the hit-test path cache so the FIRST interaction isn't a cold-start jolt. The 0.17.2 cache removed the recurring mouse lag, but on an empty cache the very first pointermove/pointerdown still flattened every hittable Bezier path in the scene at once (~one-time stall). The player now pre-flattens all hittable region/cel-material paths on `requestIdleCallback` after the first paint (when input is enabled), so that one-time cost lands during load instead of on the user's first gesture. Also exposes `FlatPlayer.warmHitCache()` and a standalone `warmHitCache(doc)` export for hosts that want to trigger it explicitly (or run in a browser without `requestIdleCallback`).
