Fix the remaining pointer lag: memoize `pathToPolygons`. Hit-testing flattened every region's Bézier curves into polygons on every item on every `pointermove`, re-subdividing identical paths and allocating fresh rings each time — heavy CPU plus massive GC churn (the dominant cost in the browser profile). A path's geometry is invariant (dynamic geometry produces new path objects, never in-place mutation), so the default-tolerance flatten is now cached in a `WeakMap<Path, Polygon[]>` keyed by path identity. The hot hit callers (`hitRegion`, `pointInMask`, `regionHit`) reuse the same path reference across moves → cache hits, no re-flatten, no per-move allocation. Hit results are identical (pure memoization). The returned rings are now shared — treat them as read-only.
