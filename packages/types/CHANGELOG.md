# @flatkit/types

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- Symbol params, clipping & CLI ergonomics:

  - **`stroke <param>`**: a `color` param can now bind a stroke, not just a fill (`path "…" nofill stroke edge 2`).
    New `Region.strokeParam`, resolved per instance at render — strokes are re-themable like fills.
  - **Free symbol section order**: `timeline`, `params`, and `states` blocks are accepted in **any order**
    before the layers (previously `params`/`states` before `timeline` gave a misleading "layer expected" error).
  - **`clip` on a container**: `group`/`instance` accept `clip <x> <y> <w> <h>` — a rectangular clip in local
    coords (new `Group.clip`/`Instance.clip`, `ClipRect` type). Cuts content outside the rect (e.g. the "feet"
    of an emerging shape) without a dedicated mask layer. Render-only (hit-test/bbox ignore it).
  - **`flatc --preview/--render --scale auto`**: picks the resolution factor from the content size — enlarges
    small/thin assets so fine filaments stay legible, leaves large assets at 1×.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Exposed typed **params** on `.flat` symbols — a symbol's public interface (restyle/tune without touching
  internals, e.g. by a small model).

  - New `params { <type> <name> = <default> [range <min> <max>] ["doc"] … }` block on a symbol. `<type>` is
    `color`, `number`, or `bool`.
  - **`color` params** feed a fill: `fill <param>` (new `Region.fillParam`), resolved per instance at render.
  - **`number`/`bool` params** become variables in the symbol's expressions (`expr y "sin(time)*wave"`,
    `"flag ? 1 : 0"`).
  - Set at the instance call-site — `instance "Boat" { hull = #1a5, wave = 1.5 }` (new `Instance.params`) —
    in `flatc --preview --set hull=#1a5,wave=1.5`, or (number/bool) at runtime via `Name.param = value`.
  - New pure module `@flatkit/engine/params` (`resolveInstanceParams`): declared defaults + call-site values,
    with state initials, into a per-instance `{ numeric, color }` scope (runtime overrides layered on top).
  - Docs: "Exposed parameters" section in the Animating a symbol guide.

  Note: param values referenced in a symbol's expressions are not yet added to the linter's known-identifier
  set (a future editor/lint refinement); color params are call-site/preview/default only (no live runtime
  color change yet).

- Exposed **named states** on `.flat` symbols (first slice of the symbol "public interface").

  - New `states <param> { <name> at <frame> … [initial <name>] [transition <n> [ease <e>]] }` block on a
    symbol. It declares an exposed param whose value selects a named state, anchored to a frame of the
    symbol's timeline.
  - The param **drives the symbol's local playhead**: `door = closed`/`0` → the closed frame, `door = open`/`1`
    → the open frame, `door = 0.5` → the authored in-between (so animating the variable plays the transition).
    States live inside the ordinary variable/expression system — no bespoke runtime.
  - `flatc --preview --set param=value` selects a state (by name or number) and bakes it into the preview,
    for both the `.flatpack` and `--render` output.
  - **Per-instance state from a program**: new `Name.param = value` action (`setParam`) addresses an instance
    by name and sets its exposed state (a state name or an expression). The player animates the declared
    `transition` automatically, and each instance keeps its own independent state.
  - New pure module `@flatkit/engine/states` (`stateFrame`, `stateValueOf`, `initialStateValue`).
  - Docs: "Named states" section (incl. `set Name.param = state`) in the Animating a symbol guide.

  Next: the broader typed `params {}` interface (colors/numbers/toggles, `fill hull`), and reading another
  object's state back by name in expressions.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- Animation authoring ergonomics for `.flat` symbols:

  - **`pose` rotate/scale in human units**: `pose "G" rotate <deg> [scale <s> | scaleX <sx> scaleY <sy>]` —
    degrees and multipliers, resolved **around the group's pivot** at render time. No more hand-written
    `matrix(cosθ, sinθ, …)` in radians. An explicit `rotate` tween interpolates linearly in degrees, so
    `rotate 0 → 360` is a full turn (not a decomposed no-op).
  - **Patch semantics for partial poses**: a pose only overrides the channels it states; position, rotation,
    scale, opacity, tint and filters it omits are inherited from the body's resting pose. `pose "G" opacity 0.5`
    now keeps the body's place instead of snapping to `0,0`.
  - **`expr` angle helpers**: `rad(deg)`, `deg(rad)`, `turns(n)` for the radians-based `rotation` channel.
  - **`flatc --preview --bbox all` (new default)**: auto-sizes the stage to the union of bounds over every
    frame (sub-timelines unfrozen), so drifting/rotating/growing motion is never clipped. `--bbox frame0`
    restores the old frame-0 measure.
  - **Docs**: new "Animating a symbol (.flat)" guide; clearer `fill none` → `nofill` error.

## 0.5.0

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Font family alias for headless `--render`: `asset "id" "font.woff2" font "Quicksand"` registers the embedded face under the declared family instead of the file's intrinsic name-table family. Fixes variable-font static exports whose name table is wrong (skia would otherwise read them as `… Thin/Light` and fall back). Browsers are unaffected (they bind families via `FontFace`); the alias only steers `flatc --render`.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Embedded fonts now render in `flatc --render`, and text supports a `stroke` (outline).

  - **`--render` registers embedded fonts**: any `asset "id" "font.woff2" font` is materialized and
    registered with skia (by its intrinsic family name) before capture, so headless PNGs use the authored
    face instead of a host fallback. `.woff2/.woff/.ttf/.otf` supported; registered families are logged to
    stderr.
  - **Text stroke**: `text "…" color #fff stroke <paint> <width> [cap …] [join …] [miter n] [dash a,b]`
    outlines the glyphs (solid or gradient paint), drawn behind the fill so the fill keeps its full weight.
    Same grammar as path/region strokes; round-trips through the `.flat`/`.flatink` DSL.
